## Spot ML

[SpotML](https://www.spotml.io/) is a command-line tool that lets you manage ML training on spot instances.

* Train entirely on spot instances to maximize savings 
* Or mix and match on-demand instances to meet your deadlines.
* Handles all infrastructure so that training is as easy as running it locally.

See [documentation](https://docs.spotml.io/) to get started.


## Note
* This is a placeholder repository. We will host the open source components here once it's ready.
* Meanwhile, join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/spotml/shared_invite/zt-xx9zgbwn-YgMF1CVn9N38TEMF8eORNQ) for Feature Requests and Bugs.

## Credit
SpotML is built on top of existing open source library [Spotty](https://github.com/spotty-cloud/spotty), and we would like to give credit to it. The goal of SpotML is not to replace the library but to further enhance the usefulness of the open source components by automating run management and provide the most cost-effective training platform.
